This was specifically written for the [Summer Nights Anthology](http://www.thegreatnovelingadventure.com/summer-nights-2/), put together by TGNA. The submissions all needed to be set during a single night, and I decided I wanted to explore a minor character. Since sharing who that is would be a spoiler, I won't, especially since I changed the point of view from him to a teenage trans boy, Yngve.
